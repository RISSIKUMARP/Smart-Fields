# Smart Field:

Smart Fields is more than a mere system; it serves as a forward-thinking companion for contemporary farmers, utilizing the capabilities of intelligence to shape an agricultural future that is both sustainable and prosperous. The web application effectively incorporates state-of-the-art technologies to detect plant diseases, provide individualized crop recommendations, and propose fertilizers based on data analysis.

Features 
Plant Disease Detection:

Achieved Prompt detection through the implementation of advanced image processing techniques and Precise identification disease . User-interface design with an emphasis on intuitiveness has been develped. 

Crop Recommendation:

Implements machine learning algorithms to provide customized crop recommendations. Environmental factors, soil conditions, and historical yields are taken into account. State-specific recommendations for achieving maximum crop yield.



Fertilizer Suggestion:

The system analyzes the soil and evaluates crop-specific nutrients. Ongoing surveillance has been built to enhance recommendations.

IoT Integration:

Soil-based IoT sensor data acquisition in real time has been implemented. Fertilizer recommendations are rendered more precise.
